# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AWS architecture for identifying and analyzing trending search queries using Amazon OpenSearch Service, AWS Glue, Amazon Bedrock, and other AWS services. The system processes search query logs, performs vector embedding and clustering analysis, and provides insights into trending queries to optimize content strategy and improve user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to automatically identify trending search queries from our application logs, so that I can optimize content strategy and improve user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search query logs are ingested THEN the system SHALL process them through Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
2. WHEN logs are received in Kinesis THEN the system SHALL store raw logs in Amazon S3
3. WHEN raw logs are stored THEN AWS Glue SHALL consolidate and catalog the data
4. WHEN data is cataloged THEN the system SHALL make it available for analysis through Amazon Athena

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to perform vector embedding and clustering on search queries, so that I can identify semantic patterns and group similar queries together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidated data is available THEN AWS Glue job SHALL create catalog tables for structured querying
2. WHEN catalog tables exist THEN Amazon Athena SHALL enable top queries/cluster analysis
3. WHEN query analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL use K-means clustering for grouping similar queries
4. WHEN clustering is complete THEN Amazon Bedrock SHALL classify top queries using LLM capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated scheduling and processing of trending query analysis, so that insights are generated consistently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN Amazon EventBridge SHALL trigger AWS Step Functions on a daily schedule
2. WHEN Step Functions are triggered THEN they SHALL orchestrate the cluster and classify search queries workflow
3. WHEN workflows complete THEN AWS Lambda SHALL compress search query logs for Amazon Simple Storage Service optimization
4. WHEN compression is complete THEN the system SHALL store results in Amazon DynamoDB for fast retrieval

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want to access trending query insights through an API, so that I can integrate this data into our search application and display trending queries to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trending queries are processed THEN the system SHALL store results in Amazon DynamoDB
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN Amazon API Gateway SHALL route requests to appropriate Lambda functions
3. WHEN Lambda functions are invoked THEN they SHALL retrieve trending query data from DynamoDB
4. WHEN data is retrieved THEN the API SHALL return trending queries in a structured JSON format
5. WHEN the search page is accessed THEN the application SHALL display trending queries to end users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the entire infrastructure to be deployed using Infrastructure as Code, so that the system is reproducible, maintainable, and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN all AWS resources SHALL be defined using AWS CDK with Python
2. WHEN CDK is used THEN the system SHALL include proper IAM roles and policies for secure access
3. WHEN resources are created THEN they SHALL follow AWS best practices for security and cost optimization
4. WHEN the stack is deployed THEN all components SHALL be properly connected and configured
5. WHEN updates are needed THEN the CDK stack SHALL support incremental deployments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the system to implement proper security controls, so that sensitive data is protected and access is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data flows between services THEN all communications SHALL use encrypted connections
2. WHEN Lambda functions access other services THEN they SHALL use least-privilege IAM roles
3. WHEN data is stored THEN S3 buckets SHALL have appropriate encryption and access controls
4. WHEN API endpoints are exposed THEN they SHALL implement proper authentication and authorization
5. WHEN logs contain sensitive information THEN the system SHALL implement data masking or filtering
